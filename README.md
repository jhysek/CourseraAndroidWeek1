I'm attending a course "Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems" (https://www.coursera.org/course/android) on Coursera and I decided to rewrite examples written in Java for Android into RubyMotion code for Android and for iOS as well. Just to practice RubyMotion and to see how each versions differ and how much code of iOS and Android versions can be shared.

- OriginalJava - original example from Coursera written in Java
- RubyMotionAndorid - Rubymotion version using the same layout file
- RubyMotionIOS - Rubymotion version for iOS. I've tried to do it in simillar way as Android version, therefore I've used Xcode for creating UI (just one label) and loading it with the IB gem.

Original examaple was created in order to show some features of Eclipse like debugger and it was not my intention to refactor it.
